*People need a way to engage with public social life in many ways. This can be direct democratic voting. Creating community groups and events. Requests for goods or labor. Make available labor or goods.*

* Bi-weekly community assemblies
* Community discussions happen both in person and online.
* Everyone gets access to a device that connects to electronic services such as social media, electronic bureaucracy, communications, community event planning. Devices are connected to each other through wireless mesh ad-hoc networking that uses garlic routing and physical token authentication. The spec and hardware is open source.
* All community action is fully transparent through distributed electronic ledgers and indexed for searching by all

* community to community action and negotiation is similarly electronically and transparently indexed

* community community action is done in a completely ad-hoc decentralized matter under free association a la democratic confederalism and council communism
