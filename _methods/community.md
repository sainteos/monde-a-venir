* Bi-weekly community assemblies always on a no work day, ad-hoc scheduling for committees.
* Monthly banquet is encouraged. The community comes together to share food, share art, play music, play games, have fun together. Not mandatory at all, but still regular for all who want.
* Dedicated community market space for exchanging goods and services. Barter is highly encouraged!
* Foster a culture of belief in the idea that at every moment, everyone is doing the best they know how to do. Even if you disagree with choices. Even if you think you have the answer. Even if they don't want help. It's time to stop being suspicious of each other and judgement of whether or not we are doing well enough in someone else's eyes.
* Public safety is not carried out by police. public safety does not exist to extract revenue. public safety should not be focused on private individual matters. public safety should consist of mediators, social workers, therapists, doctors, interventionnistes, addiction support, with a minimal amount of elected people to deal with actual dangerous situations both during and after and these people answer to the community with full transparency
