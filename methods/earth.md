*Our planet is dying. There is scientific consensus that supports the fact that the global average temperature is going up. This is having a serious effect on many aspects of our environment. Ice caps are melting. The ocean is acidifying. Weather patterns are growing more intense. Wildlife is disappearing. Natural disasters are happening more frequently and more intensely. As sea level rises, many people will be displaced, creating a refugee crisis. Islands will disappear, lowlands will flood, whole sections of continents will be under water.*
