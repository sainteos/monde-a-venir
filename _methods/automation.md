*Everybody knows there are jobs out there that no one wants to do. A specific emphasis on automating these jobs away, so humans need not do them again. Eventually, every job that people don't want to specifically do, will be automated. This frees up time and space for exploring life meaning. This allows trying new things. This allows creating art. This allows more time with your family. The logical end goal should seem utopic, having a society where "jobs" are done for pleasure or whimsy. Without constant pressure to perform, the people can flourish in their lives.*
