* 30 hour full time week
* No more than 7:30 hours for work per day including lunch
* No judgement sick, personal, mental health days
* If co-workers are worried about someone's work performance, deal on a case by case basis, co-workers needn't be worried about being open about their lives with each other if there is no possibles negative consequence that by being open they lose their job. Prioritize flexibility for all who need it. Not everybody has the same work capacity.
* Those who can't work at all or at a lower load should not be judged and should not be left behind. We take care of us.
* 3 days off means ample time for spirituality and recharging
- Automation should be encouraged and implemented first in jobs that the community requires that people don't want to do.

* Until there is automation, undesirable jobs are shared throughout the whole community, with exemption from workers that work for the community already (doctors, nurses, therapists, teachers, fire fighters, emts, crisis management, waste management, systems management, power management, water management, supply chain at all stages, large scale food management, housing management, infrastructure management, noticing that every level of job is called management because all put in work at their own ability and capacity)

* With this system, automation is welcomed and worked towards!
