*Social media in the hands of corporations for the purpose of extracting capital leaves our society open to nefarious meddling. We have seen this in the form of shady parties buying ads on Facebook that are either fake, inflammatory, etc., to foment negative discourse and divide our populations. This type of psyop can be used by anyone, a different country to benefit them, a nefarious group of people who want to slant our social web.*

There is a Gitlab project for the development of this idea [here](https://gitlab.com/hexiea_feint/common-reach).

## What do we do
* Distribute social media
	* Each person/organization owns their own data on their own devices.
	* No need for advertisements
	* Each person gets to explicitly choose what data is seen by whom
	* Each person has a public stream
	* Each person can authenticate with a physical token
	* Two main views
		* Person/Organization/Entity
		* Daily Chronicle (fb timeline except chronological)
* Views
	* Entity
		* Chronological Posts at specific permissions levels (public, group, private)
		* Other people
		* Self
	* Daily Chronicle
		* Combination of all of your streams
		* Public Stream
		* Custom Stream
* Data Creation/Management
	* Create Post
	* Edit Post
	* Delete Post
