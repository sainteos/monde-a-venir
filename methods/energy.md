*Energy should be as green as the earth. Fossil fuels are for the energy of the 20th century. There are plenty of ways to generate energy for various different uses that are not harmful for the environment either in generation or usage. Transportation can transfer to electric and hydrogen fuel. The grid can be powered by wind, hydro, geothermal, nuclear, and solar. Each place to live should have its own solar. If every family is generating power, and we are thinking clearer on our power usage, we can cut carbon output completely.*
