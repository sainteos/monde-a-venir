*Education is an important staple to keeping a healthy population. When teachers are free to teach in the way they were instructed, and with which are comfortable, and kids are supported across the spectrum of ease to educate them, our society builds off the intelligence of our ancestors. The current reactionary trend towards distrust in experts and scientists (which includes teachers), is causing much strife within our communities. Discord has been sown both by internal and external parties, and every day we are fighting about what the actual truth is. This confusion makes us completely susceptible to nefarious fascist forces that are on the rise.*
