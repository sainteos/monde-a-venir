## Creating a housing exchange system thus ending commodification of a basic life necessity
*For the purpose of achieving a 0% homeless rate, many changes can be made in the residential sector. This will require the collectivisation of residential property. The ways this can be done are as follows:*

1. Mortgages become dissolved/released
2. Mortgage holders become the de facto owner of the house they and their family live in
3. People that hold more than one mortgage, they choose the one in which they would like to stay in
4. Allow people without homes to take over rental homes left after multiple-mortgage holders choose their residence
5. People who are renting take over responsibility of the property they live in
6. Multi-residence buildings and complexes rapidly form collectives for the purpose of democratically managing the building
7. All empty properties go into a database
8. People without homes use the database to find one
9. Moving between homes is still possible by using the database
10. Choose new place, move, your previous place goes in database

##  housing is guaranteed. there are plenty of empty places in communities that could have people living in and thereby bettering their life
